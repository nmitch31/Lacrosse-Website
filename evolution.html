          In 1000 A.D. the partially Wooden Lacrosse Stick was created. The
          Algonquian tibe was the first Native American tribe to play lacrosse
          in the St. Lawrance Valley. It was originally called stick ball.

          The Native American games were large public events. They took several
          days and were played on "fields" that stretched for miles. There could
          be any number of players in the old games, said to have thousands of
          participants at a time. There were no boundaries, and the only rule
          was no touching the ball with your hands.

          In 1834 the Caughnawaga tribe showed people in Montreal how to make a

          1860.
