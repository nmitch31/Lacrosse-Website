        My website is going to be about the history and evolution of lacrosse
      </li>
      <li>
        This site will be important firstly because lacrosse has had a big role
        in my life and learning more about the history of the game that has
        impacted me so much will be beneficial for me. Also, it has been
        becoming more popular in recent years, so educating newcomers and people
        trying to get more into the sport will be beneficial for the whole
        lacrosse community! My objective is to educate people on how the oldest
        sport in America and fastest game on two feet has come to be what it is
        now.
      </li>
      <li>
        My target audience will be lacrosse players, lacrosse fans, and
        hopefully the sports community as a whole.
      </li>
      <li>
        I am planning on having a page dedicated to the creation of the game by
        the Native Americans, a page dedicated to the sport's evolution and how
        it came to be today, a page on the lacrosse stick, what it means and how
        it has changed over time, a page about the gear and gear technology, and
        lastly a page on the rules of each level, and how college lacrosse and
        professional lacrosse both play a big role in the sport.
