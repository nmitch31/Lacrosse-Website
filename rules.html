          The sport of men's lacrosse is played on two feet. Each player has
          their own stick, and there is one ball. It is typically played on a
          grass or turf field, although there is a version of the sport called
          "box lacrosse" that is played indoors.
        </div>
        <div class="rules-item">
          There are 10 players on each team, consisting of 3 attackman, 3
          midfielders (aka middies), 3 defenseman, and one goalie. There is a
          goal on either end, a midline, two box lines, and two face off wing
          lines.
        </div>
        <div class="rules-item">
          Only 6 players are allowed on either side of the midline, so while any
          position is allowed to play on the offensive half, 4 players at a time
          must stay on the defensive half. There are 4 long sticks allowed on
          the field at a time, and 1 goalie stick. This means one midfielder can
          be designated as "long stick midfielder" or "LSM". Teams will then
          switch the LSM with a short stick midfielder when they transition from
          defense to offense, as short sticks are more advantageous on offense;
          avoiding defenseman's checks is easier.
        </div>
        <div class="rules-item">
          The goal of the game is to score goals by shooting the ball into the
          net. Teams are awarded one point when they score a goal. The team with
          the most points after 4 quarters of play is the winner.
        </div>
        <div class="rules-item">
          Defense is played with body and stick. Excessive use will warrant
          penalty calls. The rules breakdown by level of play is listed below.
          You cannot touch the ball with your hand. There is a goalie crease
          around the goal, which offensive players are not allowed to step
          inside. They also cannot touch the goalie while he is inside.
